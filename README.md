The Makaan Properties Power BI Project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the status and pricing of properties across India. 
The dashboard will display the total number of properties categorized as registered, not registered, under construction, and ready to move in. 
Additionally, it will provide insights into various housing options and their prices, including a detailed analysis of price per square foot by city. 
This project aims to empower stakeholders with comprehensive data-driven insights to make informed real estate decisions.
